/// A trait for not-yet-built vhost-user devices.
///
/// Upon being given an [[Executor]], a builder can be converted into a [[vmm_vhost::Backend]],
/// which can then process the requests from the front-end.
///
/// We don't build the device directly to ensure that the device only starts threads in the jailed
/// process, not in the main process. [[VhostUserDeviceBuilder::build()]] is called only after
/// jailing, which ensures that any operations by the device are done in the jailed process.
///
/// TODO: Ideally this would return a [[VhostUserDevice]] instead of [[vmm_vhost::Backend]]. Only
/// the vhost-user vhost-vsock device uses the latter and it can probably be migrated to
/// [[VhostUserDevice]].
