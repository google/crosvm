# crosvm - The ChromeOS Virtual Machine Monitor

crosvm is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) based on Linux’s KVM hypervisor, with a focus on
simplicity, security, and speed. crosvm is intended to run Linux guests, originally as a security
boundary for running native applications on the ChromeOS platform, but now also powers Google Play Games for Windows. Compared to QEMU, crosvm doesn’t
emulate architectures or real hardware, instead concentrating on paravirtualized devices, such as
the virtio standard.

crosvm is currently used to run Linux/Android guests on ChromeOS devices.
