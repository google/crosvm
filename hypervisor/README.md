# Hypervisor Support

Multiple hypervisor backends are supported. See
[Advanced Usage](running_crosvm/advanced_usage.md#hypervisor) for overriding the default backend.

Hypervisors added to crosvm must meet the following requirements:

- Hypervisor code must be buildable in crosvm upstream.
  - Within reason, crosvm maintainers will ensure the hypervisor's code continues to build.
- Hypervisors are not required to be tested upstream.
  - We can't require testing upstream because some hypervisors require specialized hardware.
  - When not tested upstream, the hypervisor's maintainers are expected to test it downstream. If a
    change to crosvm breaks something downstream, then the hypervisor's maintainers are expected to
    supply the fix and can't expect a revert of the culprit change to be accepted upstream.
