[features]
## Default features of crosvm. This selection is somewhat arbitrary for historical reasons.
default = ["audio", "balloon", "config-file", "document-features", "gpu", "qcow", "usb"]

## Enables cross-platform audio devices
audio = ["devices/audio"]

## Enables the virtio-balloon device which allows dynamic scaling of memory via vm_control commands.
## See [Balloon Device](https://crosvm.dev/book/devices/balloon.html) for more information.
balloon = ["devices/balloon", "vm_control/balloon"]

## Enables the composite-disk format, which adds protobufs as a dependency of the build. This format
## is intended to speed up crosvm's usage in CI environments that might otherwise have to
## concatenate large file system images into a single disk image.
composite-disk = ["protos/composite-disk", "protobuf", "disk/composite-disk"]

## Enables support for JSON configuration files that can be specified using `--cfg`.
config-file = []

## Enables using gdb to debug the guest kernel.
gdb = [
    "aarch64/gdb",
    "arch/gdb",
    "gdbstub",
    "gdbstub_arch",
    "vm_control/gdb",
    "x86_64/gdb",
]

## Enables a panic handler that writes panic info to the RUST_PANIC_SIG memfd.
panic-memfd = []

## Enables the use of the qcow format for block devices.
qcow = ["disk/qcow"]

## Enables vmm-swap of guest memory. This is only available on Linux.
swap = ["vm_control/swap", "dep:swap"]

## Enables collection of VM statistics.
stats = ["devices/stats"]

## Enables trusted platform module emulation for the guest. This relies on the software emulated
## TPM implementation from libtpm2 which is suited only for testing purposes.
tpm = ["devices/tpm"]

## Enables USB host device passthrough via an emulated XHCI controller.
## USB is supported only on unix/linux. The feature is a no-op on windows.
usb = ["devices/usb"]

## Enables the non-upstream virtio wayland protocol. This can be used in conjuction with the gpu
## feature to enable a zero-copy display pipeline.
wl-dmabuf = ["devices/minigbm"]

## Enables the usage of the X11 protocol for display on the host.
x = ["devices/x"]

#! ### Graphics features

## Enables basic virtio-gpu support. This includes basic display and input features, but lacks 3D
## acceleration in the absence of other crosvm features.
gpu = ["devices/gpu", "gpu_display", "vm_control/gpu"]

## Enables 3D acceleration for guest via the gfxstream protocol over virtio-gpu. This is used for
## compatibility with the Android Emulator. The protocol provides the best speed and compatibility
## with GL/vulkan versions by forwarding the guest's calls to the host's graphics libraries and GPU.
## However, this means the sandbox is not enabled for the virtio-gpu device.
gfxstream = ["devices/gfxstream"]

## Adds a stub implementation of gfxstream to allow us to compile the gfxstream feature without
## access to the gfxstream library.
## Note that this feature only allows compilation of gfxstream and will not be functional at
## runtime.
gfxstream_stub = ["rutabaga_gfx/gfxstream_stub"]

## Enables 3D acceleration for the guest via the virglrenderer library over virtio-gpu.
virgl_renderer = ["devices/virgl_renderer"]

## Enables in development features of virglrenderer to support newer OpenGL versions.
virgl_renderer_next = ["devices/virgl_renderer_next", "rutabaga_gfx/virgl_renderer_next"]

#! ### Video features
#!
#! See [Video Device](https://crosvm.dev/book/devices/video.html) for more information.

## Enables the video decoding device
video-decoder = ["devices/video-decoder"]

## Enables the video encoding device
video-encoder = ["devices/video-encoder"]

## Enables the ffmpeg backend of video devices.
ffmpeg = ["devices/ffmpeg"]

# Enables the VAAPI backend of video devices.
vaapi = ["devices/vaapi"]

#! ### Windows-specific feature flags
#!
#! These feature flags are only available on Windows builds of crosvm.

## Enables the use of the HAXM hypervisor
haxm = ["hypervisor/haxm"]

## Enables the use of the WHPX hypervisor
whpx = ["devices/whpx", "hypervisor/whpx"]

## Enables a libslirp based network device. Currently only supported on Windows.
slirp = ["devices/slirp", "net_util/slirp"]

## Enables the Linux trace_marker backend for cros_tracing. This backend is only
## supported on Linux systems. It sends all cros_tracing tracepoints to the tracefs
## filesystem if mounted, for easier debugging with tools like trace-cmd.
trace_marker = ["cros_tracing/trace_marker"]

#! ### Non-additive feature flags
#!
#! These feature flags change the behavior of crosvm instead of adding functionality.
#! This is deprecated and will be phased out.

## Run crosvm with --disable-sandbox by default.
default-no-sandbox = []

## Special build of crosvm for ChromeOS that only supports direct device passthrough.
direct = ["balloon", "devices/direct", "arch/direct", "x86_64/direct"]

#! ### Project specific features
#!
#! These features are specific to downstream projects and may not be functional or useful
#! for standard linux builds of crosvm.
#! They are however enabled in upstream builds for compile and test coverage in CI.

#! #### ChromeOS
#!
#! These features will only be functional in ChromeOS builds running on ChromeOS.

## Enables virtio-fs quota reporting for ARCVM. Requires access to the
## org.chromium.ArcQuota dbus service.
arc_quota = ["devices/arc_quota"]

## Enables use of the ChromeOS audio server. ChromeOS builds will replace libcras_stub with an
## implementation that talks to the audio server. In upstream builds, using this option will panic.
audio_cras = ["devices/audio_cras"]

## Enables the VDA backend of the video devices. This feature requires the ChromeOS only
## libvda library and can be compiled but not linked. See b/244619291.
libvda = ["devices/libvda"]

## Builds the VDA video backend with a set of no-ops stubs instead of linking with libvda, which is
## only available on ChromeOS.
libvda-stub = ["devices/libvda-stub"]

## Enables the crosvm plugin API where functionality is provided via a FFI plugin API.
## This feature is used to integrate Parallels with crosvm and is not functional upstream.
plugin = ["protos/plugin", "crosvm_plugin", "kvm", "kvm_sys", "protobuf"]

## Enables battery reporting via the ChromeOS powerd. Requires access to the
## org.chromium.PowerManager dbus service.
power-monitor-powerd = ["arch/power-monitor-powerd"]

## Enables a virtualized TPM device that uses the org.chromium.Vtpm dbus service.
vtpm = ["devices/vtpm"]

#! #### Windows-future
#!
#! These features will only be functional in future builds of windows crosvm.

## Enables reporting of crosvm crashes
crash-report = ["broker_ipc/crash-report", "crash_report"]

#! ### Platform Feature Sets
#!
#! These feature flags enable all features that are supported for a given platform.
#! Note that these may include project specific features that will not be functional at runtime but
#! are enabled for compile and test coverage.
