/* automatically generated by rust-bindgen
See instructions from: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/print.html

Original library: https://github.com/avaneev/r8brain-free-src

To generate bindings:
1. go to the r8brain-free-src location. In my case it'll be:

    cd C:\src\kiwivm\third_party\r8brain\

2. Run bindgen and put the binding file in the win_audio r8brain_sys directory"

    bindgen .\DLL\r8bsrc.h -o ..\..\platform\crosvm\win_audio\src\r8brain_sys\binding.rs -- -x c++
