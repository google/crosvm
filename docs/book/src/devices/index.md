# Devices

This chapter describes emulated devices in crosvm. These devices work like hardware for the guest.

## List of devices

Here is a (non-comprehensive) list of emulated devices provided by crosvm.

### Emulated Devices

- [`CMOS/RTC`] - Used to get the current calendar time.
- [`i8042`] - Used by the guest kernel to exit crosvm.
- [usb] - xhci emulation to provide USB device passthrough.
- [`serial`] - x86 I/O port driven serial devices that print to stdout and take input from stdin.

### VirtIO Devices

- [`balloon`] - Allows the host to reclaim the guest's memories.
- [`block`] - Basic read/write block device.
- [`console`] - Input and outputs on console.
- [`fs`] - Shares file systems over the FUSE protocol.
- [`gpu`] - Graphics adapter.
- [`input`] - Creates virtual human interface devices such as keyboards.
- [`iommu`] - Emulates an IOMMU device to manage DMA from endpoints in the guest.
- [`net`] - Device to interface the host and guest networks.
- [`p9`] - Shares file systems over the 9P protocol.
- [`pmem`] - Persistent memory.
- [`rng`] - Entropy source used to seed guest OS's entropy pool.
- [`scsi`] - SCSI device.
- [`snd`] - Encodes and decodes audio streams.
- [`tpm`] - Creates a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) device backed by vTPM daemon.
- [`video`] - Allows the guest to leverage the host's video capabilities.
- [`wayland`] - Allows the guest to use the host's Wayland socket.
- [`vsock`] - Enables use of virtual sockets for the guest.
- [`vhost-user`] - VirtIO devices which offloads the device implementation to another process
  through the [vhost-user protocol]:
  - [frontend side]: Shares its virtqueues.
  - [backend side]: Consumes virtqueues.

## Device hotplug (experimental)

A hotplug-capable device can be added as a PCI device to the guest. To enable hotplug, compile
crosvm with feature flag `pci-hotplug`:

```sh
cargo build --features=pci-hotplug #additional parameters
```

When starting the VM, specify the number of slots with `--pci-hotplug-slots` option. Additionally,
specify a [control socket](../architecture/overview.md#the-vm-control-sockets) specified with `-s`
option for sending hotplug commands.

For example, to run a VM with 3 PCI hotplug slots and control socket:

```sh
VM_SOCKET=/run/crosvm.socket
crosvm run \
    -s ${VM_SOCKET} \
    --pci-hotplug-slots 3
    # usual crosvm args
```

Currently, only network devices are supported.
